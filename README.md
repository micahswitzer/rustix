# Rustix - A Kernel Written in Rust
Following the excellent guide written by Philipp Oppermann [here](https://os.phil-opp.com/).

## Developing
To set up your development environment, make sure `rustup` is installed from your distro's package manager
and then run `setup-env.sh` in the repo.

Execute `cargo xbuild` to build, `cargo xrun` to run, or `cargo xtest` to run tests.
